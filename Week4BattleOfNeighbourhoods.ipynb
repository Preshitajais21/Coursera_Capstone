    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This project mainly aims to help an immigrant in the city. The purpose of this Project is to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in York, Toronto.\n",
    "#### Many people settle down or immigrate to York, or they might come here for trips or for official visits then they need to do a lot of research for good and in-budget housing or maybe schools for their children. This will also help the people who want to search for different facilities in the neighbourhood like cafes, restaurants, super markets, parks, hospitals, airports, etc.\n",
    "#### This Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to York to search a best neighborhood. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities."

    "## Clustering Approach:\n",
    "#### To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n"

Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",
